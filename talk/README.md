# Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/montefiore-ai/likelihood-free-mcmc
cd likelihood-free-mcmc/talk
```
2. Start an HTTP server to serve the slides:
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
3. Visit [localhost:8000#7](http://localhost:8000#7)
  - It is best to load the 7th slide first to initialize the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo animation.

*Optional*:
